# Biography

I am an Assistant Professor in the Social and Decision Sciences department at Carnegie Mellon University. I study topics at the intersection of economics and psychology, and my research has explored the role of defaults in customer tipping behavior, learning by doing by taxi drivers, and attribution bias in consumer choice. Prior to joining the CMU faculty, I was a postdoctoral fellow with the Financial Inclusion Program at Yale University/Innovations for Poverty Action and received my PhD in economics from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business in 2016.
